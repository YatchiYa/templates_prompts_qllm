  Notes for Effective Prompting

  Be Specific : Outline exactly what aspects of the code you want to be tested
  (valid inputs, edge cases, exception handling).


  Specify Environment : Mention any libraries or frameworks to be used (like
  JUnit for testing and Mockito for mocking).


  Encourage Best Practices : Indicate a preference for testing patterns (like
  Arrange-Act-Assert) and clear naming conventions.


  Include Context : If there are additional details about the functionality or
  dependencies that are relevant, add that context.
