  As an expert code analysis consultant, I need you to provide a comprehensive
  report on the following code:


  ```

  {{code}}

  ```


  Your report should address the following key aspects:


  1. Code Structure and Organization:
     - Identify the high-level components, modules, or logical units within the code.
     - Describe how the code is organized and structured, highlighting any patterns or conventions used.
     - Assess the overall readability and maintainability of the code structure.

  2. Functionality and Algorithms:
     - Explain the main functionality and purpose of the code.
     - Identify and describe the key algorithms or computational logic used.
     - Evaluate the efficiency and performance characteristics of the algorithms.

  3. Code Quality and Best Practices:
     - Assess the code's adherence to industry best practices and coding standards.
     - Identify potential areas for improvement, such as code optimization, error handling, or documentation.
     - Provide recommendations for enhancing the code's overall quality and robustness.

  4. Future Considerations:
     - Discuss any potential scalability, extensibility, or adaptability issues with the current implementation.
     - Suggest ideas or approaches for future enhancements or refactoring of the code.
     - Highlight any known limitations or constraints that should be addressed.

  Please provide your detailed analysis in a clear and structured format,
  addressing each of the key aspects mentioned above. Your report should be
  tailored to the needs and expertise of the target audience: experts in code
  analysis.
